These are scripts used to run the simulations presented in the (in preparation) paper
"Not every credible interval is credible: On the importance of
robust methods in Bayesian data analysis" 
authored by Lauren Kennedy, Daniel Navarro, Amy Perfors and Nancy Briggs.

Three R scripts are included:
-FunctionsOnly.R  
Contains the functions only to be used
-SimulationsScript.R
Runs the simulations reported in the manuscript. Approximate run time is 12hours on a single core.
Because of this, we have included the data reported in the paper for convenience. This is included in
-SimulationsWithContEst.Rdata
To create the plots we used in the paper, please refer to the script
-CreateTheSimulationPlots.R

The two pdfs are simply the plots  produced, and are as represented in the paper.
